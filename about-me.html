              <p class="text">I’m Software Developer from Latvia. I have been studying Creative Media And Game Technologies in Saxion University of Applied Science located in Enschede, Netherlands. 
                Now I’m working for Qbit Latvia as Software Developer. My main responsibilities there are to develop web application using C#, 
                ASP.NET and Blazor, as well as developing and integrating widgets into application called Jedox using JavaScript and PHP.</p>

          <p class="text">
            For past years I have multiple working experiences which are quite different in projects type, therefore some of the core technologies used for them are the same.
             My first Internship was at TotalReality, company focused on developing VR and AR solutions.
              There I was working developing an AR application for 5Senses which was used as promo and developed Kinect game for museum called StichtingGelderman.
              Second Internship was at Xsens, company known for developing one of the best motion capture suits in the world.
               This was my graduation Internship, and I was developing a plugin for live data transfer from Xsens software to the VFX creation software Houdini to move objects live inside it. 
              Because I graduated with this project you can be sure this project was successful. After that I stayed at this company working as Productions Engineer for some time. 
            Later, I got offered a position in Qbit Latvia, here I’m working as Web Applications developer and integrating widgets into Jedox.

                <p class="text">
                  My study was 4 years long bachelor’s degree in Creative Media and Game Technologies (Game Engineering) which is equivalent to computer science. 
                  There I learned game engine called Unity and C# as main coding language for that engine. 
                  During my study I had multiple projects developed in groups which were games and enterprise related projects.
                   Also, I had two internships half year long each. My Internships took place in Duch companies Total Reality and Xsens(currently Movella).
